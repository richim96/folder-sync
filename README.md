# ðŸ”„ folder-sync
One-way, periodical synchroniser for two folders.

- The synchronisation maintains a full, identical copy of the source folder at the replica folder.
- File creation/copying/removal operations are logged to a third file and to the console.
- Folder paths, synchronization interval, and log file path can be provided via CLI.
